title: UI Overview
description: Surface MCP tool results as UI widgets alongside the reply, or fold them into text — controlled per agent via UIPolicy.
---

When a tool returns a `UIPayload`, an agent can either emit it as an `AgentEvent.widget` (rendered next to the reply) or silently fold the data into the text answer. The choice is `UIPolicy`, set at agent construction time.

![A shopping assistant answering the same question two ways: on the left, a text reply plus a rich product-card widget rendered from an MCP UI payload; on the right, the same reply as text only.](/agent-squad/swift/mock-compare.png)

The same agent and the same tool data produce either of these. On the left, the tool's `UIPayload` — typically delivered from an [MCP](/agent-squad/swift/mcp/overview/) server — is emitted as a `.widget` event and the host renders the product card alongside the text. On the right, `UIPolicy.suppress` (or a tool with no UI) yields a text-only answer. The widget's `structuredContent` is render-only and is never fed back to the model.

See [Built-in Curators](/agent-squad/swift/ui/built-in/curators/) for the `ToolOutputCurator` implementations that ship with AgentSquad, or [Custom Curator](/agent-squad/swift/ui/custom/) for rolling your own.

## UIPolicy

```swift
public enum UIPolicy: Sendable {
    case forward   // emit AgentEvent.widget — the app renders the component
    case suppress  // data stays text-only; widget is never emitted
}
```

Both `Agent` and `GroundedAgent` accept `ui: UIPolicy` (default `.forward`). With `.forward`, every `ToolResult` whose `ui` property is non-nil emits a `.widget(UIPayload)` event through the stream. With `.suppress`, the data still reaches the model via the tool-result message — nothing is lost, just never surfaced as a component.

```swift
// Text-only agent — no widgets emitted
let agent = Agent(
    name: "Scores",
    model: client,
    tools: scoreTools,
    ui: .suppress
)

// Widget-emitting agent (the default)
let agent = Agent(
    name: "Scores",
    model: client,
    tools: scoreTools
    // ui: .forward is the default
)
```

## Consuming `.widget` events

```swift
for try await event in agent.process(input, history: history, context: ctx) {
    switch event {
    case .textDelta(let delta):  appendText(delta)
    case .widget(let payload):   renderWidget(payload)
    case .final:                 break
    default:                     break
    }
}
```

:::note
`AgentEvent.widget` is **never** fed back to the model. `structuredContent` and `meta` are render-only, so the model cannot reference or hallucinate from them.

## UIPayload

The value emitted on `.widget`:

```swift
public struct UIPayload: Sendable, Codable, Hashable {
    public let resourceURI: String        // e.g. "ui://sport/matches"
    public let mimeType: String           // e.g. "text/html;profile=mcp-app"
    public let template: UITemplate?      // nil until lazily fetched via resources/read
    public let structuredContent: JSONValue  // data the component hydrates from
    public let meta: JSONValue?           // widget-only metadata; absent when none
    public let security: UISecurity?      // CSP / permissions / sandbox domain
}
```

`template` is populated lazily when the host calls `resources/read` for `resourceURI`. Until then it is `nil` — the widget can still render if the host already has the template cached.

---

## UITemplate

The resolved resource content:

```swift
public enum UITemplate: Sendable, Codable, Hashable {
    case html(String)        // text/html;profile=mcp-app
    case url(URL)            // text/uri-list
    case remoteDOM(String)   // application/vnd.mcp-ui.remote-dom
}
```

---

## UISecurity

Controls the Content Security Policy your host enforces when rendering the component. Undeclared domains are blocked.

```swift
public struct UISecurity: Sendable, Codable, Hashable {
    public let connectDomains: [String]   // fetch / XHR / WebSocket
    public let resourceDomains: [String]  // img, media, fonts
    public let frameDomains: [String]     // iframe src
    public let permissions: [String]      // e.g. "camera", "microphone", "geolocation"
    public let domain: String?            // dedicated sandbox origin
    public let prefersBorder: Bool
}
```

---

## ToolVisibility

Declares which audiences may invoke a tool — set on `AgentTool` and propagated from MCP via `_meta.ui.visibility`.

```swift
public struct ToolVisibility: OptionSet, Sendable, Hashable {
    public static let model = ToolVisibility(rawValue: 1 << 0)
    public static let app   = ToolVisibility(rawValue: 1 << 1)
    public static let all: ToolVisibility = [.model, .app]  // default
}
```

A tool with `.app`-only visibility is never offered to the model in `LLMRequest.tools`, so the model cannot call it — only the UI component can.

```swift
let appOnlyTool = AgentTool(
    name: "refreshWidget",
    description: "Refresh the live scores widget",
    visibility: .app          // model never sees this tool
)
```

---

## GroundedAgent and UIPolicy

In a `GroundedAgent`, the gatherer always runs with `.suppress` — widgets are held back until after curation. The primary tool's `UIPayload` is then emitted once, before the presenter speaks, so the widget arrives ahead of the text answer.

```swift
let agent = GroundedAgent(
    name: "Sport",
    gatherer: fastModel,
    presenter: preciseModel,
    tools: sportTools,
    curator: .dataBlock,
    presenterPrompt: .default,
    ui: .forward          // widget emitted from the primary tool before presenter text
)
```

Set `ui: .suppress` on a `GroundedAgent` to produce a pure text answer with no widget, while still using the two-LLM grounding pipeline.
