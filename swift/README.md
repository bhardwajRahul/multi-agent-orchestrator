## Requirements

- **iOS 16+** / **macOS 14+**
- **Swift 6.2** toolchain (Xcode 26+), Swift 6 language mode

The whole framework runs on **iOS 16+**, including the bundled `FileChatStorage` (JSON-file
persistence). The one piece gated higher is `DeviceChatStorage` (SwiftData), which needs **iOS 17+ /
macOS 14+**. iOS 15 is not supported: the MCP Swift SDK and core `Duration`/`ContinuousClock`/
`URL.appending(path:)` all require iOS 16.

## What this is

A multi-agent framework built to **run on device**: small protocols you extend, swappable agents,
classifier routing, and pluggable chat storage — plus what an on-device assistant needs:

- 🧠 **Swappable agents** — pick a simple single-LLM agent, or a grounded *Brain → Presenter* agent
  that answers only from what the tools actually returned.
- 🔌 **Remote or on-device models** — use any remote, OpenAI-compatible LLM today; run models fully
  on device *(soon)*.
- 🧰 **Tools from any source** — Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, native Swift functions, or a
  mix; the agent doesn't care where a tool comes from.
- 🪟 **Text or rich UI** — answers come back as plain text or as text plus interactive widgets, your
  choice per agent.
- 🎙️ **Realtime voice** — natural spoken conversations with interrupt-to-speak, as a first-class part
  of the framework.
- 📈 **Built-in tracing** — see every step of a run, locally during development or shipped to your
  observability tool of choice.
- 💾 **Local-first chat history** — conversations persist on device, with storage you can swap out.

## How it works

<p align="center">
  <img src="../docs/public/how-it-works.png" width="880" alt="High-level flow: user input goes to a Classifier, which uses the chat history to select an agent; the chosen agent (Agent, GroundedAgent, or your own) processes the turn and replies; the chat history is read and saved along the way — all running on device.">
</p>

1. **Classify** — user input arrives and the Classifier reads it (with the chat history) to route the turn.
2. **Select** — it picks the best agent for the job: a plain `Agent`, a `GroundedAgent`, or one of your own.
3. **Process** — the chosen agent runs the turn (calling tools as needed) and produces the reply.
4. **Store & respond** — the turn is saved to the chat history and the answer goes back to the user.

Single-agent apps skip the classifier entirely — the orchestrator just runs your one agent.

## Introducing GroundedAgent: Grounded Answers

`GroundedAgent` is the framework's anti-hallucination pattern: **two LLMs**, not one.

<p align="center">
  <img src="../docs/public/grounded-agent.png" width="880" alt="GroundedAgent: a Brain LLM runs the tools with the full context (one prompt for all tools, plus the chat history); a Tool Output Curator shapes the gathered results; a tool-less Presenter LLM — no history, no tool responses, just a per-data prompt — speaks grounded only on that tool output.">
</p>

- **Brain** — one system prompt (shared across all tools) with full instructions, the chat history, and the tools. It
  decides what to fetch, calls the tools, and produces the **tool output** — but never speaks to the
  user.
- **Presenter** — no tools, no chat history, no tool responses, no generic instructions. Just the
  **tool output** plus a small prompt chosen for the specific data being shown. With nothing to call
  and only the output in front of it, it can't invent values beyond what was actually fetched.

A no-tool turn answers in one pass — the Brain replies directly, no Presenter. The same
Brain → tool output → Presenter core also powers the realtime voice runtime.

### The prompts

The **Brain** runs one system prompt for all tools — role, the full tool catalog, and the rules for
gathering and resolving follow-ups:

```text
You are the data brain of a shopping assistant.
GATHER the facts needed to answer the user — never write the final reply.

Tools:
  search_products(query, max_price)  → matching products
  get_product(id)                    → details · price · rating · stock
  get_order(id)                      → order + delivery status

Rules:
- Call whatever tools you need; you may chain several.
- Use the chat history to resolve follow-ups ("cheaper ones?", "is it in stock?").
- Never invent values. If a tool returns nothing, note that.
- Do NOT address the user or format anything — the presenter does that.
```

In a real assistant this is *the big one* — easily several hundred to a couple thousand tokens once
the full tool catalog, domain rules, and output policy are in.

The **Presenter** instead picks **one small prompt for the data being shown** (a few dozen tokens
each) — here, the one for product results:

```text
You are presenting product search results.
Use ONLY the data block provided — never invent a price, rating, name, or stock status.
Lead with the best match: its name and price, then one standout detail.
Two short sentences, natural tone. Do not call tools.
```

### Tool UIs → widgets

The same answer can come back as **plain text**, or as **text plus UI elements** (cards, lists, and
the like) — you choose per agent. When a tool has a UI to show, the framework can surface it as a
**widget** next to the reply, or fold everything into a text-only answer.

<p align="center">

</p>

## Quick start

A complete first run — a tiny command-line executable you can `swift run`.

**1. Create the package** — `Package.swift`:

```swift
// swift-tools-version: 6.0
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "quickstart",
    platforms: [.macOS(.v14)],
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/2FastLabs/agent-squad", branch: "main")
    ],
    targets: [
        .executableTarget(name: "quickstart", dependencies: [
            .product(name: "AgentSquad", package: "agent-squad")
        ])
    ]
)
```

**2. Write it** — `Sources/quickstart/main.swift`. One agent, no classifier (the common case):

```swift
import AgentSquad
import Foundation

guard let apiKey = ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["OPENAI_API_KEY"] else { fatalError("set OPENAI_API_KEY") }
let model = ChatCompletionsClient(model: "gpt-4o-mini", apiKey: apiKey)

let agent = Agent(name: "Shop", description: "Shopping assistant", model: model)

let orchestrator = Orchestrator(
    agents: [agent],
    store: try DeviceChatStorage(userId: "u1", inMemory: true)
    // classifier defaults to nil → no routing hop; the one agent always answers
)

for try await event in orchestrator.route(.text("wireless headphones under €100?"),
                                          userId: "u1", sessionId: "s1") {
    if case .textDelta(let token) = event { print(token, terminator: "") }
}
print()
```

**3. Run it:**

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-… swift run
```

### Routing between agents

Give the orchestrator more than one agent and an `LLMClassifier`, and it routes each turn to the
best fit — the call site doesn't change:

```swift
let shop    = Agent(name: "Shop",    description: "Product search, prices, recommendations.", model: model)
let support = Agent(name: "Support", description: "Orders, returns, and account help.",        model: model)

let orchestrator = Orchestrator(
    agents: [shop, support],                  // the first agent (shop) is the default/fallback
    classifier: LLMClassifier(model: model),  // picks the agent for each turn
    store: try DeviceChatStorage(userId: "u1", inMemory: true)
)

for try await event in orchestrator.route(.text("where is my order #1234?"),
                                          userId: "u1", sessionId: "s1") {
    if case .textDelta(let token) = event { print(token, terminator: "") }
}
```

From here: give an agent a `ToolProvider` for tools, or swap `Agent` for `GroundedAgent` — none of
it changes the call site.

## Modules — add only what you use

The package ships as **separate libraries** so the core stays dependency-free; you import only
the integrations you need (each isolates its own dependencies):

| Library | `import` | Pulls in | Contents |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`AgentSquad`** (core) | `import AgentSquad` | **nothing external** | protocols, `FileChatStorage`, `DeviceChatStorage` _(iOS 17+)_, `InMemoryChatStorage`, `OSLogTracer`, agents, orchestrator |
| **`AgentSquadMCP`** | `import AgentSquadMCP` | the official [MCP Swift SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/swift-sdk) | `MCPServer` (alias of `MCPToolProvider`) — connect any MCP server with `MCPServer(url:)`, with MCP Apps UI support |

So an app that doesn't use MCP never downloads the MCP SDK. Future optional integrations
(e.g. `AgentSquadLangfuse` for trace export) follow the same pattern — the core never grows a
dependency. Add a product to your target's `dependencies` to use it:

```swift
.target(name: "MyApp", dependencies: [
    .product(name: "AgentSquad", package: "agent-squad"),
    .product(name: "AgentSquadMCP", package: "agent-squad"),   // only if you want MCP tools
])
```

## Architecture

Two peer runtimes share one set of contracts but not a control loop: a turn-based `Orchestrator`
(classify? → dispatch → stream → persist) and a long-lived `RealtimeSession` for voice. Agents,
tools (`ToolProvider`), storage (`ChatStorage`), and tracing (`Tracer`) are all swappable protocols;
optional integrations (MCP, tracing exporters) ship as separate products so the core stays
dependency-free.

## Building with an AI assistant

This repo ships a **skill** — a single, assistant-agnostic guide at [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) with the
mental model, the real API signatures, task recipes, and the gotchas, for both the built-in types and
writing your own.

It isn't auto-installed — point your assistant at it. For example, tell it:

> *Read `SKILL.md` before writing any AgentSquad code.*

Works with any assistant (Claude, Cursor, Copilot, …). Claude Code users can also drop it in as a
skill: copy it to `.claude/skills/agent-squad-swift/SKILL.md`.
